=================

XenCenter has plugin capabilities which allow you to add custom menu items or even whole tabs to the XenCenter window. You might do this as an ISV to integrate your own product with XenCenter, or as an end-user to integrate with your company's existing inventory management, for example.  This repository contains the complete specification for developing XenCenter Plugins, plus examples of how to create a Plugin written in various languages.

Questions related to these samples can be posed on the XenServer development list [xs-devel] (http://xenserver.org/discuss-virtualization/mailing-lists.html)
